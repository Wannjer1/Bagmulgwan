# Bagmulgwan

Bagmulgwan is a Korean name meaning museum. The Bagmulgwan application is a virtual gallery that displays images of different types.

## Behaviour Driven Development

The user is able to:

- View different photos of different types
- Click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details per photo. The photo appears on a modal within the same route as the main page.
- Search for different photo categories within the app.
- View photos based on the location they were taken
